			<h1> Lab 13: For Loopz! </h1>
			<figcaption> here is a portrait of kai, boy genius, shout out to kai!!! </figcaption>
				<p> The purpose of this lab was to introduce the wonderful world of loops!
					Loops are cool blocks that allow us to do the same actions as many times
					as we want, or until something isn't the case anymore. With loops we can
					do all kinds of repetitive things with very little code.</p>

			<h2> Challenges </h2>
				<p> While getting the loop and modulus functions to work was exceptionally easy,
					the real challenge arose when we started attempting to add "checkers" into the
					form input. Basically, some code that prevents you from putting garbage into the
					program which otherwise might break it. While not a bonus task exactly,
					implementing this in an efficient way took a lot of time and a lot of trial and error.</p>
				</div>

				<div id= "problems">
			<h2> Problems </h2>
				<p> The biggest problem we ran into was this strange quirk of the code that
          gets the form input from the user. Because JS is not a data-typed language,
          and forms are most of the time "strings", when we attempted to use a JS Number.isInteger()
          method, it kept returning false even if the number we passed it was very much a real number.
          It turns out the problem was that regardless if you input a number or a string into the form,
          it will always give you the .value in the form of a string, which confuses the Number.isInteger()
          method. So to fix this we needed to use a parseInt() function to convert the value into an Int,
          and then check if the parseInt function returned an Int or a NaN by using the .isInteger()
          method. This whole bit took more than an hour to fix, but it's working very well now!</p>

					<p id="desc"><b>Here's the final result!</b><br>
						If the number is a multiple of 3, it should print "Fizz!"<br>
						If the number is a multiple of 5, it should print "Buzz!"<br>
						If the number is a multiple of 7, it should print "Boom!"<br>
						<p><b>Input the nuber of values you want to check!</b></p>

			<h1> Lab 15: AJAX and JQuery are ugly names, have to be honest here. </h1>
				<p> The purpose of this lab was to get used to using AJAX in tandem with JQuery and scalping stuff
					from the internet. This proved to be confusing at first, but we got the hang of it pretty quick!</p>
			</div>

			<h2> Challenges </h2>
				<p> The hardest thing about this lab was getting the syntax of everything
					working right! The ajax parameters are unique to each API and need to be
					set accordingly. This took a while but eventually worked well!</p>

			<h2> Problems </h2>
				<p> One problem we ran into was trying to display the data we had pulled
					from APOD on our page. The problem was that the data would take a moment
					to load in, and that if you tried to access it from an external variable
					outside the ajax function, it would return an "undefined" as it tries to
					run that code long before the server has actually given us the info. We
					were able to fix this by calling our "parse object" function from within
					the AJAX success! parameter. it works but wish we had more flexibility with it!</p>

			<h3> Results! </h3>
				<p>I have been a 'daily' visitor of APOD for almsot 10 years so natrually I was
					going to pick it as my API. Thankfully they made it pretty simple to use,
					just had to sign up for an API key.</p>

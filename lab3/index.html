	<h1> Lab 3 File Structures </h1>

	<p1> The idea of this was was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files </p1>

	<h2> Challenges</h2>
	<p2> The problem I keep running into is my images not showing on my web page, an annoying photo icon with a slash through it keeps coming up! <p2>
	<h2> Results </h2>
	<p3> I realized that my file names were not the same, it was a mater of .JPG vs .jpeg
				the other time this happened my image landed in the wrong folder, and I didnt know that we
				had to put the folder name before the /img" </p3>
